# Let's Explore New York

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/upperlinecode/NYC_Boroughs_Lab)](https://repl.it/github/upperlinecode/NYC_Boroughs_Lab)

## Intro
New York City is made up of 5 very distinct boroughs: Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island. Each borough has its own unique attractions and populations.

## Task
If you take a look in your index.html file you'll see that you've been given a page with 5 divs. Each one of these divs has an id corresponding to a different borough has been styled to have a different background color.

### 1. Label The Boroughs
Your first task is to go through each div and **create an h2 element stating the name of the borough.** The text should appear **inside** the colored box designated for that borough.

### 2. Add Images of the Attractions 
Next, go through the list of attractions below, find pictures of them online, and **use an image element to place them in the correct borough in your html.**

**What to Place**

1. Coney Island
2. Central Park  
3. Statue of Liberty
4. Pelham Bay Park
5. New York Wheel
6. Prospect Park
7. Empire State Building
8. Yankee Stadium
9. Bronx Zoo
10. Staten Island Zoo
11. Brooklyn Botanic Garden
12. Citi Field
13. JFK Airport


### 3. Add Learn More Links [Stretch]
Find a website that your users can visit to learn more about each attraction and use an [anchor tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp) to include them underneath the image of each attraction. 
Hint: Consider placing the anchor element inside another element if you want it to appear on a seperate line and not adjacent to the image. 
**Bonus points** if you can get the links to open up in a new window!
